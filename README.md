# Virtual-Restaurant

This program is a user interface of an experimental restaurant,
where the customers don't get a food menu but instead, state their
food preference and food will be prepared for them, based on their
preference. The program also calculates how much the customers have
to pay for the food. 

The user input in this program will be to enter the scale (1 to 100) to which
they prefer a particular food item and the amount of money they have for the food.
Once the user has entered all the inputs, the program will calculate the results and
prepare a "virtual meal". At the end of the program, the output will be the
total amount of money due, including tax.
